    // In Java, the variable is called reference variable

    // In Java, the variable is called an object because we use new keyword

    // Look in Java Array is an object so it must have a class which it Inherits. The class name is called an object which is by default allocated to the array.

    // In Java, Array occupy memory in heap so all object and Array gets stored in the heap

    // Loop in Java with primitives. If you use them like an array, the JVM has to do some internal conversion to make it into Wrapper classes, but in array, it direct executes thatâ€™s why Arrays are fast

    // If the array size is fixed, you cannot change its value on runtime, like you cannot increase or size so wastage of Memory Size for excess

    // You can only store similar data types in array

    // You can also store objects in an array

    // If you delete any value of array in between, then we have to traverse the rest remaining Arrays more of like shifting them

    // Do not have add or remove methods
