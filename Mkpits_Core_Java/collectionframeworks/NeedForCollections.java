// The Need for Collections: Going Beyond Arrays in Java

// While arrays offer a familiar and simple way to store data in Java, their limitations often become evident as your programs grow in complexity.
// Enter the **Java Collections Framework**, a powerful toolkit that addresses these limitations and provides numerous advantages for effective data management.


// Here's why collections are essential in Java:

// 1. Overcoming Array Limitations:

// Fixed Size: Arrays have a predefined size you cannot change after creation. Collections, on the other hand, are dynamically resizable, adapting to your data needs by growing or shrinking as necessary.
// Homogeneous Data: Arrays can only store elements of the same type. Collections can hold heterogeneous elements of different types, offering greater flexibility and versatility.
// Manual Operations: Common tasks like adding, removing, searching, and sorting require manual coding with arrays. Collections provide ready-made methods for these operations, saving you time and effort.

// 2. Enhanced Functionality:

// Variety of Collection Types: The framework offers different collection types like lists, sets, and maps, each with specific strengths and use cases. Lists maintain element order, sets eliminate duplicates, and maps associate keys with values.
// Efficient Data Organization: Collections help organize data logically, making it easier to access, manipulate, and analyze. This improves program efficiency and readability.
// Reusable Code: Code utilizing collection methods and interfaces is less prone to errors and more easily reused in different parts of your program.

// 3. Real-World Benefits:

// Managing Complex Data: Collections are especially crucial for handling large and diverse datasets often encountered in real-world applications.
// Improved Algorithm Performance: Certain collection types offer inherent efficiency advantages for specific algorithms, boosting program performance.
// Maintainable and Scalable Code: By leveraging collections, your code becomes cleaner, more modular, and easier to scale as your data requirements grow.

// In conclusion, while arrays remain a fundamental data structure, the Java Collections Framework offers a vast array of benefits for managing data effectively and efficiently. Consider utilizing collections whenever your program needs dynamic size, flexible data types, pre-built operations, diverse organization options, or efficient data handling.

        // Printing the original list
        System.out.println("Original List: " + numbersList);

        // Using ready-made methods for common operations
        Collections.sort(numbersList);
        System.out.println("Sorted List: " + numbersList);

        // Adding more elements to the list
        numbersList.add(3);
        numbersList.add(1);

        // Printing the updated list
        System.out.println("Updated List: " + numbersList);
