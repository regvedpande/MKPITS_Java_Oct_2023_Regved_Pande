    <!-- This HTML form, with the ID "form1," is designed to collect user information. It includes input 
        fields for "Name," "Password," and "City." The default form action is set to "userform.html" for 
        regular user submissions. Notably, there are two submit buttons: "Submit" for regular users and 
        "Admin Submit" for administrative purposes, redirecting to "adminform.html" due to the specified 
        "formaction" attribute. This allows a single form to serve different actions based on the button 
        clicked, enhancing the form's versatility in handling different user roles or scenarios. -->
