    <!-- This HTML document includes a form with the ID "form1." The form's "action" attribute 
        is set to "userform.html," indicating the destination for form data upon submission. 
        The "target" attribute is set to "_blank," causing the form to open the response in a
        new browser window or tab. The form contains input fields for "Name," "Password," and 
        "City." Upon submission, the data is sent to "userform.html," allowing for user information
        collection in a new browser context. -->
