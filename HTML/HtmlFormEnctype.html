    <!-- This HTML form with the ID "form1" is configured with the "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" 
        encoding type, suitable for standard form submissions. It includes input fields for "Name," "Password,"
        and "City." The "Submit" button triggers the default form submission, while the "Admin Submit" button, 
        with the "formenctype" attribute set to "multipart/form-data," indicates a different encoding type for 
        more complex data, often used in file uploads. This dual-button setup allows the form to handle different
        types of submissions based on user roles or data requirements. -->
