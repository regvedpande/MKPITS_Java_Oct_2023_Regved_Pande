    <!-- This HTML form with the ID "form1" utilizes the "get" method, indicating that form data 
        will be appended to the URL for submission. It includes input fields for "Name," "Password," 
        and "City." The default "Submit" button triggers a "get" request, while the "Admin Submit" button,
        with the "formmethod" attribute set to "post," ensures a "post" request for a potentially more secure
        and complex operation, like handling administrative actions. This design allows the form to manage 
        different types of requests based on user roles or data handling requirements. -->
