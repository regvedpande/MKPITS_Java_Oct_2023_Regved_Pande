        <p>Quantum computers represent a revolutionary paradigm in computing, leveraging the principles of quantum mechanics to process information in ways fundamentally different from classical computers.<br> Unlike classical bits, quantum bits or qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously, thanks to superposition. Quantum entanglement allows qubits to be interconnected in a way that the state of one qubit can instantaneously affect the state of another, regardless of distance. This unique property enables quantum computers to perform complex calculations exponentially faster than classical counterparts for specific tasks, <br>
        such as factoring large numbers or simulating quantum systems. However, quantum computing is still in its early stages, facing challenges like maintaining qubit coherence, and its full potential is yet to be realized. <br>
        Researchers are actively exploring applications that could revolutionize fields like cryptography, optimization, and drug discovery.</p>
