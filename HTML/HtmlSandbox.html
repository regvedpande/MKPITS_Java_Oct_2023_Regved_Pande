<h1>HTML Sandbox Example</h1>

<!-- A sandbox in HTML, often implemented with the <iframe> element and the sandbox attribute,
is used to isolate and restrict potentially unsafe content within a secure environment. 
It provides a protective boundary for executing scripts, preventing malicious actions and 
enhancing overall web security. Sandboxing is commonly employed to mitigate potential risks 
associated with third-party or untrusted content on a web page.-->
