        <!--In this HTML form with the ID "form1," the "action" attribute is set to "userform.html,"
        specifying the destination for form data upon submission. The "target" attribute is set to "_blank,"
        causing the form to open the response in a new browser window or tab. The form includes input fields 
        for "Name," "Password," and "City." There are two submit buttons - "Submit" for regular users and "Admin"
        for administrative actions. The "formtarget" attribute on the "Admin" button is set to "_self," causing 
        the form to submit within the same browser window. This design allows for different form submission 
        behaviors based on the button clicked. -->
