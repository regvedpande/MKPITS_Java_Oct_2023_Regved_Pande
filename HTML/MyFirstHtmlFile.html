    <h1> Quantum Computers</h1>

    <p>Quantum computers leverage principles of quantum mechanics to process information using qubits, which can exist in multiple states simultaneously. Unlike classical bits, qubits enable parallel computations, potentially solving complex problems exponentially faster. Quantum superposition and entanglement enhance computational power, but maintaining qubit coherence remains a challenge. Despite ongoing advancements, practical applications for quantum computers are still emerging.</p>
