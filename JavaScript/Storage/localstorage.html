/* Local Storage is a feature that allows storing key-value pairs directly in a web browser.
    The provided code utilizes this feature by setting two key-value pairs, namely 'regved' and
    'pande', using the `localStorage.setItem()` method. It then retrieves and logs the value 
    associated with the 'regved' key using `localStorage.getItem()`, along with other details
    such as the first key and the total number of keys in local storage. Additionally, the code
    includes options to remove specific items or clear all items from local storage when necessary.*/

		// Setting items in localStorage
		localStorage.setItem('regved', 'pande');
		localStorage.setItem('regregd@outlook.com', '9049874883');
		
		// Retrieving and logging data from localStorage
		console.log("Username:", localStorage.getItem('regved'));
		console.log("First key in localStorage:", localStorage.key(0));
		console.log("Number of items in localStorage:", localStorage.length);
		
		// Removing an item from localStorage
		localStorage.removeItem('email');
		
		// Clearing all items from localStorage
		// localStorage.clear();
