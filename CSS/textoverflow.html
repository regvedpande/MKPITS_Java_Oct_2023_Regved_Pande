    <h2>Milky Way Galaxy</h2>
    <p>The Milky Way galaxy, our celestial home, spans an immense 100,000 light-years across.
        It harbors billions of stars, including our sun, within its spiral arms. A cosmic tapestry
        of gas, dust, and stellar phenomena adorns its vast expanse. The Milky Way is part of a galactic
        neighborhood called the Local Group, contributing to the cosmic dance of galaxies in the universe.
        Its mysteries continue to captivate astronomers, inviting exploration and unlocking the secrets
        of our cosmic origins.</p>
