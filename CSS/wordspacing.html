    <h2>Vedic Age</h2>
    <p>The Vedic Age, spanning from around 1500 BCE to 600 BCE, witnessed the composition of 
        the sacred Vedas, forming the cornerstone of Hinduism. Society evolved from pastoral 
        and nomadic to settled communities, establishing a four-fold social structure and the 
        foundation of the caste system. Vedic religion was characterized by polytheistic rituals 
        and sacrifices dedicated to various deities. Political organization transitioned from tribal
        kingships to territorial states known as janapadas. The Vedic Age laid the groundwork for later
        philosophical developments seen in texts like the Upanishads and Brahmanas.</p>
