    <h1>Meteors</h1>
    <p>Meteors, also known as shooting stars, are celestial objects that enter Earth's atmosphere at high speeds, 
    creating a spectacular streak of light as they burn up due to friction. These cosmic travelers are often remnants 
    of asteroids or comets, composed of various minerals and metals. The fleeting brilliance of meteors is a result of 
    intense heat generated during their atmospheric entry. Meteor showers occur when Earth passes through the debris trail
    left by a comet, leading to a heightened display of these luminous phenomena. Studying meteors provides valuable insights
    into the composition and origins of our solar system.</p>
