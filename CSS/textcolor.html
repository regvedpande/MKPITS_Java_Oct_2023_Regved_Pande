    <h1>Coal</h1>
    <p>Coal, a relic of ancient sun, compressed and dark,
        Powered progress, forged the modern spark.
        Yet smoke stains skies, whispers of warming's wrath,
        A legacy etched, a crossroads on our path.
        Can we shift gears, leave fossil chains behind,
        Seek cleaner sources, where nature's breath entwines?
        The choice is ours, the future's ink we write,
        Black gold or green hope, bathed in dawning light.
        But echoes call, from mountains stripped and scarred,
        Can human ingenuity heal where it marred?</p>
