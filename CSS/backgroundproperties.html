    <h2>Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor</h2>
    <p>
        The F-22 Raptor's story began in the Cold War as a joint effort to build an air superiority fighter.
        It soared onto the scene in 1997, boasting stealth technology, unmatched maneuverability, and powerful
        engines. Despite controversy and cost concerns, it served admirably in the War on Terror, scoring air-to-air
        victories and showcasing its dominance. However, production ended in 2009, leaving the F-22 a unique and potent,
        though limited, force in the U.S. arsenal.
