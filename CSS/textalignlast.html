    <h2>Cloud Computing</h2>
    <p>Cloud computing is a technology paradigm that involves the delivery of computing services, including
        storage, processing power, and software, over the internet. Instead of relying on local servers or 
        personal devices, users can access and use resources hosted on remote servers provided by cloud 
        service providers. Key characteristics of cloud computing include on-demand access, scalability, 
        and resource pooling. It is categorized into three main service models: Infrastructure as a Service
        (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). Cloud computing offers flexibility,
        cost-effectiveness, and accessibility, making it a popular choice for businesses and individuals for diverse
         computing needs.</p>
