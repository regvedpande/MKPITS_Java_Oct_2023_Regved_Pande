    <h1>Nuclear Physics</h1>
    <p>Nuclear physics is a branch of physics that studies the properties and behavior of atomic nuclei.
        It explores the structure of atomic nuclei, their interactions, and the processes involving nuclear
        reactions. This field encompasses topics like nuclear decay, fission, fusion, and the behavior of 
        subatomic particles within atomic nuclei. Nuclear physics plays a crucial role in understanding 
        fundamental aspects of matter, energy, and the universe, with applications ranging from energy 
        production in nuclear reactors to medical diagnostics and treatments.</p>
