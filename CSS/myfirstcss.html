    <h2><b>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</b></h2>
    <p>CSS, born in the early 1990s, emerged as a crucial web development tool to separate content and presentation.
        Introduced by the W3C, CSS Level 1 in 1996 and subsequent versions evolved, offering enhanced styling options.
        The modular CSS3 in 2001 enabled continuous updates, including the 2014 release, solidifying CSS's role in creating
        visually appealing, responsive web designs. Today, CSS remains foundational, continually adapting to the dynamic demands
        of web development and design.</p>
