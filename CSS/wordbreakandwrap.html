    <h2>Time</h2>
    <p>Time is a fundamental dimension in which events occur and is often measured in seconds, minutes, hours, and so on. It is a continuous, irreversible progression from the past through the present to the future. Time is relative, as described by Einstein's theory of relativity, meaning it can be experienced differently depending on one's relative motion and gravitational field. Time is intimately connected with space in the fabric of spacetime.
        The standard unit of time, the second, is defined based on atomic vibrations, providing incredible precision. Time dilation occurs when an object is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light or is in a strong gravitational field, causing time to pass more slowly for that object compared to a stationary observer. Time is dynamic and constantly flows, and it is the framework within which the universe unfolds, shaping the sequence 
        of events that make up our existence. Our perception of time can vary subjectively based on experiences and emotions.</p>
