    <h2>Computers</h2>
    <p>Computers are electronic devices designed for processing and storing data, performing calculations,
        and executing tasks based on instructions. They consist of hardware components such as the central 
        processing unit (CPU), memory, storage, input/output devices, and a motherboard that connects and 
        coordinates these elements. Computers operate on binary code, representing data in the form of ones
        and zeros. The evolution of computers has seen a progression from large mainframes to personal computers,
        laptops, and modern mobile devices. They play a pivotal role in various fields, facilitating tasks like information processing, communication, entertainment, and scientific research. Advances in computer technology continue to drive innovation, shaping the way we live and work in the digital age.</p>
