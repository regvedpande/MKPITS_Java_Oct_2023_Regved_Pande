<!-- The provided HTML document utilizes an ID selector named `idselector` in the embedded CSS. 
    The styles defined within the `#idselector` rule apply to the HTML element with the ID "idselector,"
    which in this case is an `<h3>` heading. The specified styles include a text color of chocolate, a font
    family consisting of various options, and left alignment. This demonstrates how the ID selector allows for 
    specific styling of individual elements within the HTML page. -->
