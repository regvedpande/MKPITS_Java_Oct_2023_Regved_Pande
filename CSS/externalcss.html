<!-- External CSS separates the soul (styles) from the body (HTML). This creates readable code,
    allows universal style changes, and promotes collaboration, making web development a harmonious symphony.  -->

    <h2>External CSS</h2>
    <p>External CSS involves separating the style rules of an HTML document into a distinct 
    external file with a ".css" extension. This file is linked to the HTML document using the 
    element within the section. External CSS promotes a cleaner and more maintainable code structure
    by centralizing styling information, allowing for consistent design across multiple pages. Changes
    to the styling can be applied universally by modifying the external CSS file, streamlining the development process.
    Additionally, this approach enhances the efficiency of web pages by reducing the size of HTML files and facilitating
    better collaboration between developers and designers.</p>
