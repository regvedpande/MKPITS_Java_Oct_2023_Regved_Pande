## **Description**

This repository is my dedicated space for practicing and mastering the essential components of Java Full Stack development. Here's what you'll find:

* **Backend development with Java and Spring Boot**
* **Elegant frontend design using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**
* **Relational database management with SQL**
* **Dynamic web experiences with JSP and Servlets**

## **Technologies**

* **Java (Version)**
* **Spring Boot (Version)**
* **HTML5**
* **CSS3 (with Framework if applicable: Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, etc.)**
* **JavaScript (Vanilla JS or Framework/Library: React, Angular, Vue)**
* **SQL (Database System: MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.)**
* **JSP**
* **Servlets**

## **Getting Started**

**Prerequisites**

* Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or higher ([download here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/))
* An IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code.
* Maven (for dependency management)
* MySQL (for the database) 

**Installation and Setup**

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/regvedpande/MKPITS_Java_Oct_2023_Regved_Pande.git
    ```

2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd MKPITS_Java_Oct_2023_Regved_Pande
    ```

3. **Database Setup**
    * Create a MySQL database named 'your_project_db'
    * Import the `database_schema.sql` file (located in the `sql` folder) if applicable.

4. **Run the Spring Boot Application**
    * From your IDE, locate the main application class (e.g., `Application.java`) and run it.
    * Or, from the command line, navigate to the project root and run: `mvn spring-boot:run`

## **Demo**

* **If web-based, provide a URL:** (e.g., http://localhost:8080) if your project is runnable locally.
* **If not, include screenshots or a GIF:**  Demonstrate the core functionality visually.

## **Features**

* **Feature 1: User Authentication and Authorization** 
    * Secure signup and login system using password hashing and secure token storage.
    * Role-based permissions to control access to different sections or functionalities of the application.

* **Feature 2:  Responsive Web Design**
    * Implementation of CSS media queries and/or a responsive framework (e.g., Bootstrap) to ensure the application adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes (desktops, tablets, phones).
    * Prioritizes mobile-friendly interactions and layouts.

## **Future Development**

* **Enhanced User Experience:** Implement smoother navigation, intuitive form interactions, and refined UI animations to elevate user engagement.
* **Advanced Features:** Integrate real-time updates using WebSockets for instant notifications, implement collaborative editing for shared documents, and incorporate recommendation systems for personalized user experiences.
* **Performance Optimization:** Focus on caching strategies to minimize server load, conduct code profiling to identify and optimize performance bottlenecks, and fine-tune database queries for faster response times.
* **Robust Testing:** Expand test coverage with comprehensive unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests using frameworks like JUnit and Selenium.
* **Security:** Strengthen security measures with stringent input validation, data encryption for sensitive information, and robust authentication/authorization mechanisms.

## **Contributing**
